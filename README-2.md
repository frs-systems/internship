## Internship
Following tasks are not all mandatory, nor are there any specific rules to do them.
Any programing language is allowed.
After completion you'll be asked about your solution. https://onecompiler.com/python

 

## Task 1
A binary tree is a data structure in which each node has at most two children. There are three common depth-first traversal methods for binary trees: preorder, inorder, and postorder.

Part A:
Write a function in Python that implements one of these depth-first traversal algorithms for a binary tree. Clearly indicate which traversal method you are implementing.

Part B:
Analyze the time and space complexity of your algorithm in terms of n, the number of nodes in the tree. Explain your reasoning.


## Task 2
Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm
A weighted graph is represented using an adjacency list, where each node is connected to other nodes with a given weight.

Part A:
Write an algorithm that implements Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm to find the shortest distance from a given source node to all other nodes in the graph. You may use Python or pseudocode.

Part B:
Analyze the time complexity of your algorithm based on the data structure used for the priority queue (e.g., an array vs. a binary heap).
