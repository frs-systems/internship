## Internship
Following tasks are not all mandatory, nor are there any specific rules to do them.
Any programing language is allowed.
After completion you'll be asked about your solution. https://onecompiler.com/python

 

## Task 1
A palindrome is a word which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam or racecar.

Write a method that receives a word as parameter and returns a boolean determining whether the word is a palindrome or not, in the most efficent way possible. Justify why it's the most efficient one.
Tell the computational and space complexity ie  O(n), O(log n)

i.e.:
boolean checkPalindrome(String word) { ...


## Task 2
Having an array of any size of Longs. Implement a Bubble sort script.

Tell the computational and space complexity ie  O(n), O(log n)

i.e.:
Long[] bubbleSort(Long[] longs) { ...

## Task 3
Having an array of any size of Longs. Implement a Quick sort script.

Tell the computational and space complexity ie  O(n), O(log n)

i.e.:
Long[] quickSort(Long[] longs) { ...


## Task 4
Having an array of any size of Longs and a long to search. Implement a binary search script.

Tell the computational and space complexity ie  O(n), O(log n)

i.e.:
boolean binarySearch(Long[] longs, Long toBeSearched) { ... 

## Task 5
Chose best aproach between BubbleSort and QuickSort algothim.
Explain why.
